### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christian Reitan and I am a medical doctor/PhD currently residing in Stockholm, Sweden. I conduct research within the field of cardiology. I have a special interest for coding, preferrably in R, and I enjoy using coding tools for a (ideally) fully reproducible research process. My research focuses on epidemiological studies, mainly using registries. 

Today, I use GitHub mainly to collaborate on research projects (most of my repos are at this point thus private, at least before publication). On my spare time, I sometimes like to create packages and tools related to registry research for R and Rmarkdown. I also use GitHub for random things as holding my CV for instance.

Apart from work, I enjoy a lot of things. I ususally document them with one of my many cameras. I mainly use my Fujifilm X-series or my Hasselblad 500 C/M, preferrably loaded with Portra 400 which in my opinion has the best mix of a retro film look and accurate picture quality.
