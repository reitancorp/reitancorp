### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christian Reitan and I am a medical doctor/PhD currently working in Stockholm, Sweden. I do research within the field of cardiology. I have a special interest for coding, preferrably in R, and I enjoy using coding tools for a (ideally) fully reproducible research process. My research focuses on epidemiological studies on patients with coronary artery disease, mainly using registries. 

I use GitHub mainly to collaborate on research projects (most of my repos are at this point thus private, at least before publication). On my spare time, I sometimes create packages and tools related to registry research for R and Rmarkdown. I also use GitHub for random things such as holding my CV.

Other than work, I enjoy a lot of things. I usually document them with one of my many cameras. I mainly use my Fujifilm X-series or my Hasselblad 500 C/M, preferably loaded with [Portra 400](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/portra400/) which in my opinion has the best mix of a retro film look and accurate picture quality.
